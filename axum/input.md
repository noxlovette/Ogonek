# Notes

## Culture

### Architecture

The picture shows the Transamerica Pyramid in the Financial District of San Francisco, California. It is the second tallest skyscraper in San Francisco. More and more modern skyscrapers are being built next to historic buildings around the world, showing sharp contrasts between old and new architecture.

### Slow Movement

The main philosophy of the Slow Movement is to do everything at the right speed in order to enjoy everything you do. It started in 1986 in Italy when Carlo Petrini wanted to protest against the opening of a McDonald's restaurant in one of the most famous attractions in Rome, which led to the creation of the Slow Food organisation. The Slow Movement covers many other areas now: Slow Cities, Slow Travel, Slow Living and Slow Design. The Slow Movement is not a single organisation, but is run by people all over the world.
